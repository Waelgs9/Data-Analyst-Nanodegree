# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree

## Prerequisites
Some familiarity with SQL and Python programming including common data analysis libraries (like Numpy and Pandas).

## About
In this program we learn the skills required to organise data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions and communicate critical findings. We accomplish this using Python (along with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL.

- **Estimated Duration**: 5 Months  <br/>


## Curriculum

####  Introductory Project - Exploring Weather Trends
In this introductory project we are introduced to SQL and how to download data from a database. We analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends depending on where we live to overall global temperature trends.

###  1. Introduction to Data Analysis
In this introductory lesson, we are introduced to the key steps in the data-analysis process. We learn how to setup up our own programming environment using Anaconda software distributition. We are exposed to Jupyter Notebooks, which is an open source web application for combining explanatory text, equations, code and visualisations in a shareable document. We later learn how to use Numpy, Pandas to wrangle, explore, analyse and visualise our data.

#### Project - Investigate a Dataset
In this project, we choose from one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. We complete the entire data analysis process, starting from posing a question to finishing it by sharing our findings. 

### 2. Practical Statistics
In this lesson, we are introduced to the world of statistics. We learn the fundamental rules of probability, binomial distribution, conditional probability and baye's theorem. We later learn normal distribution and standardising it using z-score. We also come across hypothesis testing and central limit theorem and how they can be used to make decisions. 

We compare differences between two groups and test their effect using t-tests and A/B testing. Using regression models, we try to understand the relationships between independent and dependent variables. We conclude by learning about logistic regression and how it is useful in making predictions between categorical dependent variables.

#### Project - Analyse Experiment Results
In this project, we are provided with a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. We use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report our conclusions and recommendations in a report. 

### 3. Data Wrangling
In this lesson, we learn the data-wrangling process (gathering/assessing/cleaning) data. We learn how to download data from multiple sources including flat-files(CSV/TSV), web documents(HTML/XML) and APIs (Application Programming Interface). We learn the importance of scraping data and downloading it programatically using different libraries in python. We assess quality and tidiness issues and check for accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity. Finally, we learn how to clean out data in a systematic fashion (define/code/test).

#### Project - Wrangle and Analyse Data
In this project, we gather data from a variety of sources using python, assess its quality and tidiness, and then clean it. Along the way we document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL

### 4. Data Visualisation with Python
In the last lesson, we learn why visualisation is important in the context of data analysis. We identify differences between exploratory and explanatory analysis. We learn about different encodings useful in depicting data. We begin with understanding of univariate(single-variable) exploration using histograms and countplots. We move to bivariate(two-variables) exploration using heatmaps and clustered-bar charts. We finish with multivariate(more than two variables) where we encodings like shape, size, color to encode values of third variable. Along the way, we learn how to transform our visualisations, polish out plots and understand the pitfalls that can effect the truthfulness of visualisations.

#### Project - Communicate Data Findings
In this project, we use Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, we create a presentation that communicates ours findings to others.
